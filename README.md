# PEP43
Excerise 43 from Project Euler. https://projecteuler.net/problem=43 

\nThe solution has three main steps.
1.Find the permutations of 0123456789.
2.Return the permutations that have the sub-string-divisiblity condition.
3.Sum these permutations.

This is not the fastest solution but it works.
